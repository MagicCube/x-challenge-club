This project use `Gulp` and `Webpack` as the builder and module manager, while
`Babel` as ES6 compiler and `LESS` as the CSS pre-processor.

```sh
$ gulp
```
All the client JavaScript codes and resources will be minified and uglified
by default. Please see the compiled result in the `./assets`.

`gulp clean` is supported.
