To simplify the building process, just get started by using
```sh
$ gulp
```
All the client JavaScript codes and resources will be minified and uglified
by default. Please see the compiled result in the `./assets`.

`gulp dist` and `gulp clean` are also supported.

$ gulp run
```

```sh
$ gulp dev
```
